# Assumptions

## Cameras at Fish Farm Enclosures

1. There is an existing system that does fish/parasites recognition.
2. The IOT devices should be able to either store data themselves or to local storage device. This storage size will be determined by the frequency of outages in the farm's side. This will enable us to not loose any info while there is big network outage where the IOTs are not able to reach to our system.


## Development team

1. Development team is relatively small, and the proposed solution should enable fast time-to-market and ease of changes
2. Development team is cross-functional and have experience with major technologies available on the market
