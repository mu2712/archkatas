## Status

Accepted

## Context
Fish watch is a fast growing system with various services interacting with each other, it makes scaling essential. 
Proper and trustworthy monitoring is the basis for making any decision about infrastructure changes (i.e. scaling, extensibility etc), proper monitoring should support business decisions.
We'd like to use a system that helps us get the full picture of correlated business events, connected services and amount of consumed resources.

#### Power BI

Power BI is a Microsoft offering for creating various reports and sending alerts based on the severity levels of the inspected matrix. Approximate cost is $10 USD per user/month.

## Decision

We decided to choose Power BI as we have predominently decided to Azure and other Microsoft stack. Also, Power BI provides a very strong analytical abilities, Plus we do have to impart extra from a dev/adminstrator to take care of monitoring.

## Consequences
The cost of the project increase as we decided to use a paid service.

## Tradeoff
We choose to save dev/sys admin time over cost.
